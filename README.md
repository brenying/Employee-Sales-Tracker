# Employee Sales Tracker

## Objective

The Employee Sales Tracker project aimed to simulate a system for tracking employee sales. The program allows creating an employee object, recording multiple sales amounts, and printing a summary of the employee’s sales and information.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing classes and dynamic memory allocation in C++.
- Using member functions to manage and update employee data.
- Storing and summing multiple sales entries.
- Encapsulation and object-oriented programming principles.
- Printing formatted output to summarize employee performance.

### Tools Used

- C++ language features including classes, pointers, and dynamic memory.
- Header files for class definitions (`employee.h`).
- Standard input/output (`cin`, `cout`) for displaying employee sales information.
